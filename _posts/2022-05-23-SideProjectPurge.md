Yo, I decided to pop back on here with a quick rundown of what's been going on at the landfill, SIDEPROJECTS. Yup got about 5 running concurrently. For those of you that have been keeping up with my [Twitter](twitter.com/hoodstrats)(*pretty dead right now*) you've already seen my posts on the Twitch overlay/Game I've been working on. I took a long extended break from that Project about 6 months or so, due to burn out (it happens). Like many of my other projects, it's pretty much in it's final stages of development. I had just finished implementing a modding system where the users can drop their own sprites in a mod folder and the game will import/take care of the rest. Well, before I start rambling on about how difficult it was getting that system in place, I just want to say that I'm about ready to dive back into it, but I have a bunch of other Projects I still want to finish up first. A couple months ago I already finished up some and [released](https://hoodstrats.github.io/Projects/) them. Today I bring you another. 

This one is a bit different. As much as I love creating stuff from scratch, I've always had an interest in Modding. Most recently I played a fair bit of Monster Hunter Rise and as much as the combat has improved from previous titles, it still lacked the "oomph" I was looking for. Luckily since it's using the new RE Engine, the [REFramework](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/26) by praydog also works here. They did an amazing job of pretty much exposing a ton of engine information to Modders and gave it a nice LUA scripting frontend. So yea, that "oomph" I wanted, I decided to go ahead and add that by juicing up the damage numbers in game. I've always been a fan of huge damage numbers, like that of Korean MMOs because to me it always gave me that feeling of power fantasy. 

I had a lot of fun poking around the game's code, using the framework. Messing around with LUA and hooking onto game methods to see what worked. I finally managed to find the right methods to alter and how to alter them. Here's the mod:

[NUMBER FANTASY MOD](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/720)
## NOTE: This is purely cosmetic, so it won't effect your actual damage. 

Yep, there it is. This is just one of the many projects I wanted to tackle/finish. Theres still a few more projects I want to finish up here, currently up in the queue is another Twitch Bot for my channel. I've been cannibalizing some of the code from my Twitch Overlay game, generalizing it a bit and adding more functionality. I plan on streaming some DEV at some point, but I've been very scattered brain lately and my schedule is all over the place. I'll make another post about that when the time is right, time to AFK.

*If you're playing Monster Hunter Rise and like big damage numbers you know what to do.*
