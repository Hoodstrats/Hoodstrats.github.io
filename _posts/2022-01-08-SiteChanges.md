Yo. You probably made it here from my [Twitch Page](twitch.tv/hoodstrats). Welcome to the Project Graveyard, that's housed within another graveyard, this site. 
Just like many of my other projects this website quickly became a side project and put in the back burner. I'm finally starting to wrap up a lot of my other projects, mostly ones that are pretty much done but never got around to "finishing" them. I'm revamping the projects page with links to all my stuff and might eventually
make that the home page. This blog page will have it's own section but most the site updates are going to occur within that projects page. I have been keeping notes
on all my projects, stuff that I've learned along the way including:

- C# in general as a whole, so many bugs and fixes that I never found answers to
- Tips for Gamedev in general 
- Unity quirks that some tutorials don't cover
- Godot engine stuff especially when it comes to the C# implementation
- Game design stuff, Notes, my own documentation etc 

Just a bunch of stuff that I would love to, at some point convert into posts for this blog. For now however, you can check out one of those projects I mentioned. This is a small CLI TOOL I finished up to automatically grab wallpapers from windows spotlight (those login wallpapers). It's a small tool I made what feels like ages ago, and I recently converted it into a NUGET package. It currently requires the[ .NETCORE 3.1 Runtime Framework](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/4e95705e-1bb6-4764-b899-1b97eb70ea1d/dd311e073bd3e25b2efe2dcf02727e81/dotnet-runtime-3.1.22-win-x64.exe
) and you can download it directly from the NUGET website at this link: [SpotYoink](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpotYoink/). If you know how to mess with NUGET packages through the Windows CLI you can simple run this command:
 
`dotnet tool install --global SpotYoink --version 1.0.1` 

I also started working on a GUI version (with interface) in GODOT, which I will be uploading soon. It started out as a practice project, to experiment using Godot's C# implementation and it's interface framework. Many many many hoops were jumped through, but I'll go into detail when that project gets uploaded

That's all for now. Over the next few days or so, expect things to be moved around and random changes happening throughout the site.
